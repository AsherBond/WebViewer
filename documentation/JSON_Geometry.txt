OPENWEBGLOBE GEOMETRY EXCHANGE FORMAT VERSION 1.0
=================================================

Geometry Objects consist of 
   1) Vertex Semantic
   2) Array of Vertices
   3) Index Semantic
   4) Array of indices

Every geometry object has a vertex semantic.
The following vertex semantics are currently supported:

    "pnt":  Position, Normal, Texcoord
    "pc":   Position, Color
    "pt":   Position, Texcoord
    "pnct": Position, Normal, Color, Texcoord
    
Points are always x,y,z floating points
Normals are always x,y,z floating points
Texcoords are always u,v floating points
Colors are always r,g,b floating points [0,1]    


Index Semantic
   "POINTS"
   "LINES"
   "TRIANGLES"


EXAMPLE:
========

{
   "VertexSemantic" : "pnt",
   "Vertices" : [1.2,2.31,12.312, ...],
   "IndexSemantic": "TRIANGLES",
   "Indices" : [0,1,2,3,4,5]
}


Please note that in this first version of the Geometry Exchange format, user data is not yet supported.
